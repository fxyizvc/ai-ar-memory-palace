# ai-ar-memory-palace

Artificial Intelligence Driven Augmented Reality System for Data Augmentation is
designed to enhance memory and retrieve data by transforming real world spaces into
interactive Memory Palaces (object / container) using AI based object detection and AR
virtualization. It helps users to anchor and recall information through spatial interaction.
It serves as a cognitive enhancement tool by integrating AI and Augmented Reality to
support memory recall and spatial learning. It functions by recognizing physical objects
in the environment and overlaying relevant digital content like notes, images or videos
directly onto them through an AR interface. By combining AR and AI, the system not
only supports human memory and spatial awareness, but also opens new opportunities in
education, fashion, advertisement and medical fields.
In the first stage, the system utilizes a mobile device’s camera and AR capabilities to
detect real world objects, using AI based object detection. In the second stage, once an
object is identified, the system checks a cloud database for associated digital memories
such as text, images or videos linked to that object. In the third stage, these memories
are then fetched for visualization. In the fourth stage, the memories are visualized in
augmented reality spatially anchored around the detected object. In the fifth stage, this
transforms the user’s environment into a personalized interactive ”Memory Palace” that
aids in learning and data recall.
