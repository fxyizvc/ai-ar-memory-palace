Univeristy Final Year Project.

> Created a website to upload PDF files and it creates a summarized version of that PDF using BART AI summarizer model.
> Summarized text is then converted to a 3D flashcard model on website itself and its stored in Google Drive.
> Using Unity 6 Engine, created an app that detects blackboard using a trained ONNX model.
> Using AR technology, from the detected board, we fetch the coordinates and overlays the flashcard on the board.
> Making it easy for recalling subjects and its contents easier for this innovative future driven education.
