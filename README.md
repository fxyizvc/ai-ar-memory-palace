🧠 AI AR Memory Palace

University Final Year Project
An AI-powered Augmented Reality system that transforms learning materials into immersive 3D memory aids for enhanced recall and understanding.

📌 Project Overview

AI AR Memory Palace is an innovative educational platform that combines Artificial Intelligence, 3D visualization, and Augmented Reality to improve how students recall and understand academic content.

The system converts uploaded PDFs into summarized content, transforms them into interactive 3D flashcards, and overlays them onto real-world classroom environments using AR, enabling intuitive and spatial learning.

🚀 Features

📄 PDF Upload & Summarization

Upload academic PDF files through a web interface

Automatically summarizes content using the BART AI summarization model

🧠 3D Flashcard Generation

Summarized text is converted into interactive 3D flashcard models

Flashcards are stored securely in Google Drive

🎯 Blackboard Detection

A custom-trained ONNX object detection model identifies blackboards in real time

🕶️ Augmented Reality Overlay

Uses Unity 6 Engine to detect board coordinates

Dynamically overlays 3D flashcards onto the detected blackboard

📚 Enhanced Learning Experience

Spatial placement of information improves memory retention

Makes recalling subjects and concepts faster and more intuitive
