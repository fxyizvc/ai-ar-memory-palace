# 🧠 AI AR Memory Palace (Smart Blackboard)

**University Major Project | B.Tech CSE**
*An AI-powered Augmented Reality system that transforms learning materials into immersive 3D memory aids for enhanced recall and understanding.*

## 📌 Project Overview
AI AR Memory Palace is an innovative educational platform that combines Artificial Intelligence, 3D visualization, and Augmented Reality to improve how students recall and understand academic content.

The system converts uploaded PDFs into summarized content via a Web Interface, transforms them into interactive 3D flashcards, and overlays them onto real-world classroom environments using AR, enabling intuitive and spatial learning.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📄 PDF Upload & Summarization (Web Module)
* Upload academic PDF files through a web interface.
* Automatically summarizes content using the **BART AI model**.

### 🧠 3D Flashcard Generation
* Summarized text is converted into interactive 3D flashcard models.
* Flashcards are stored securely in **Google Drive**.

### 🎯 Blackboard Detection (AR Module)
* A custom-trained **TensorFlow Lite (SSD)** model identifies blackboards in real-time on mobile devices.
* Operates on a background thread for high-performance inference (>30 FPS).

### 🕶️ Augmented Reality Overlay
* Uses **ARFoundation** to anchor content to the physical world.
* Dynamically streams 3D flashcards from the cloud (Google Drive) without app updates.
* **Auto-Correction:** Flashcards automatically rotate to face the user and "pop out" 30cm from the board for better visibility.

## ⚙️ AR System Architecture (Technical Workflow)

### 1. Computer Vision Pipeline (The "Eyes")
* **Input:** Captures the live camera feed and resizes textures to a `640x640` tensor.
* **Inference:** Passes the tensor to a quantized `.tflite` model (MobileNet SSD).
* **Output:** Returns normalized bounding box coordinates `(cx, cy, w, h)` and a confidence score.

### 2. Spatial Mapping (2D to 3D)
* The system converts the AI's 2D screen coordinates into Unity screen pixels.
* A **Raycast** is fired from the camera center through the detected 2D center point.
* The ray intersects with the **AR Plane** (physical wall) generated by ARCore's LiDAR/Depth sensor.

### 3. Cloud Content Delivery
* Once the physical anchor point is established, the app initiates an asynchronous web request.
* It streams a `.glb` (3D model) file directly from a secure **Google Drive** link.
* **Optimization:** Used `glTFast` for non-blocking asynchronous loading to maintain high FPS.

### 4. Anchoring & Stabilization
* **AR Anchors:** The system attaches an `ARAnchor` component to the downloaded object. This hands over position control to ARCore, ensuring the object stays "locked" to the blackboard even if the camera moves.
* **Visual Cleaning:** Automatically disables the AR Point Cloud (dots) upon successful detection for a clean UX.
